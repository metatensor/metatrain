Contributing
============
ðŸŽ‰ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute to metatrain! ðŸŽ‰

If you want to contribute but feel a bit lost, do not hesitate to contact us and ask
your questions! We will happily mentor you through your first contributions.

Area of contributions
---------------------
The first and best way to contribute to metatrain is to use it and advertise it
to other potential users. Other than that, you can help with:

- documentation: correcting typos, making various documentation clearer;
- bug fixes and improvements to existing code;
- adding new architectures
- and many more ...

All these contributions are very welcome. We accept contributions via Github `pull
request <https://github.com/metatrain/pulls>`_. If you want to work on the code
and pick something easy to get started, have a look at the `good first issues
<https://github.com/metatensor/metatrain/labels/Good%20first%20issue>`_.


Bug reports and feature requests
--------------------------------
Bug and feature requests should be reported as `Github issues
<https://github.com/metatrain/issues>`_. For bugs, you should provide
information so that we can reproduce it: what did you try? What did you expect? What
happened instead? Please provide any useful code snippet or input file with your bug
report.

If you want to add a new feature to metatrain, please create an `issue
<https://github.com/metatensor/metatrain/issues/new>`_ so that we can discuss it,
and you have more chances to see your changes incorporated.


Contribution tutorial
---------------------
In this small tutorial, you should replace `<angle brackets>` as needed. If anything is
unclear, please ask for clarifications! There are no dumb questions.

Getting started
---------------
To help with developing start by installing the development dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install tox


Then this package itself

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/metatensor/metatrain 
  cd metatrain 
  pip install -e .

This install the package in development mode, making it importable globally and allowing
you to edit the code and directly use the updated version. To see a list of all
supported tox environments please use

.. code-block:: bash

  tox list

Running the tests
-----------------
The testsuite is implemented using Python's `unittest`_ framework and should be set-up
and run in an isolated virtual environment with `tox`_. All tests can be run with

.. code-block:: bash

  tox                  # all tests

If you wish to test only specific functionalities, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

  tox -e lint          # code style
  tox -e tests         # unit tests of the main library
  tox -e examples      # test the examples


You can also use ``tox -e format`` to use tox to do actual formatting instead of just
testing it. Also, you may want to setup your editor to automatically apply the `black
<https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ code formatter when saving your files, there
are plugins to do this with `all major editors
<https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/editor_integration.html>`_.

If you want to test a specific archicture you can also do it. For example

.. code-block:: bash

      tox -e soap-bpnn-tests

Will run the unit and regression tests for the :ref:`SOAP-BPNN <architecture-soap-bpnn>`
model. Note that architecture tests are not run by default if you just type ``tox``.

.. _tox: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest

Contributing to the documentation
---------------------------------
The documentation is written in reStructuredText (rst) and uses `sphinx`_ documentation
generator. In order to modify the documentation, first create a local version on your
machine as described above. Then, build the documentation with

.. code-block:: bash

    tox -e docs

You can then visualize the local documentation with your favorite browser using the
following command (or open the :file:`docs/build/html/index.html` file manually).

.. code-block:: bash

    # on linux, depending on what package you have installed:
    xdg-open docs/build/html/index.html
    firefox docs/build/html/index.html

    # on macOS:
    open docs/build/html/index.html

.. _`sphinx` : https://www.sphinx-doc.org

Contributing new architectures
------------------------------
If you want to contribute a new model pleas read the pages on
:ref:`architecture-life-cycle` and :ref:`adding-new-architecture`.
