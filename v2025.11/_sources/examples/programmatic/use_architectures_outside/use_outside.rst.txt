Using metatrain architectures outside of metatrain
==================================================

This tutorial demonstrates how to use one of metatrain's implemented architectures
outside of metatrain. This will be done by taking internal representations of a
NanoPET model (as an example) and using them inside a user-defined torch ``Module``.

Only architectures which can output internal representations ("features" output) can
be used in this way.

Read some sample systems. Metatrain always reads systems in float64, while torch
uses float32 by default. We will convert the systems to float32.

Define the custom model using the PET architecture as a building block.
The dummy architecture here adds a linear layer and a tanh activation function
on top of the PET model.

Now we can train the custom model. Here is one training step executed with
some random targets.

.. code-block:: Python

    my_targets = torch.randn(100, 1)

    # instantiate the model
    model = PETWithTanh()

    # all metatrain models require neighbor lists to be present in the input systems
    systems = [
        get_system_with_neighbor_lists(sys, get_requested_neighbor_lists(model))
        for sys in systems
    ]

    # define an optimizer
    optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)

    # this is one training step
    predictions = model(systems)
    loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(predictions, my_targets)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
