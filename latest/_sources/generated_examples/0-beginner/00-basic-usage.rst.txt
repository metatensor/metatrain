Basic Usage
===========

``metatrain`` is designed for a direct usage from the command line (cli). The program
is registered via the abbreviation ``mtt`` to your command line. The general help of
``metatrain`` can be accessed using

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 10-11

.. code-block:: Bash

    mtt --help

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 12-51

We now demonstrate how to ``train`` and ``evaluate`` a model from the command line.
For this example we use the :ref:`architecture-soap-bpnn` architecture and a subset of
the `QM9 dataset <https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201422>`_. You can obtain the
dataset for this example here: :download:`qm9_reduced_100.xyz <qm9_reduced_100.xyz>`.


Training
--------

To train models, ``metatrain`` uses a dynamic override strategy for your training
options. We allow a dynamical composition and override of the default architecture
with either your custom ``options.yaml`` and even command line override grammar. For
reference and reproducibility purposes ``metatrain`` always writes the fully expanded,
including the overwritten option to ``options_restart.yaml``. The restart options file
is written into a subfolder named with the current *date* and *time* inside the
``output`` directory of your current training run.

The sub-command to start a model training is

.. code-block:: bash

    mtt train

To train a model you have to define your options. This includes the specific
architecture you want to use and the data including the training systems and target
values

The default model and training hyperparameter for each model are listed in their
corresponding documentation page. We will use these minimal options to run an example
training using the default hyperparameters of an SOAP BPNN model

.. literalinclude:: options-basic.yaml
   :language: yaml

For each training run a new output directory in the format
``outputs/YYYY-MM-DD/HH-MM-SS`` based on the current *date* and *time* is created. We
use this output directory to store checkpoints, the restart ``options_restart.yaml``
file as well as the log files. To start the training, create an ``options.yaml`` file
in the current directory and type

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 54-56

.. code-block:: Bash


    mtt train options-basic.yaml

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 57-61

The functions saves the final model `model.pt` to the current output folder for later
evaluation. An `extensions/` folder, which contains the compiled extensions for the
model, might also be saved depending on the architecture. All command line flags of
the train sub-command can be listed via

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 65-66

.. code-block:: Bash

    mtt train --help

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 67-95

After the training has finished, the ``mtt train`` command generates the
``model.ckpt`` (final checkpoint) and ``model.pt`` (exported model) files in the
current directory, as well as in the ``output/YYYY-MM-DD/HH-MM-SS`` directory.

Evaluation
----------

The sub-command to evaluate an already trained model is

.. code-block:: bash

    mtt eval

Besides the trained ``model``, you will also have to provide a file containing the
system and possible target values for evaluation. The system section of this
``eval.yaml`` is exactly the same as for a dataset in the ``options.yaml`` file.

.. literalinclude:: eval-basic.yaml
   :language: yaml

Note that the ``targets`` section is optional. If the ``targets`` section is present,
the function will calculate and report RMSE values of the predictions with respect to
the real values as loaded from the ``targets`` section. You can run an evaluation by
typing

We now evaluate the model on the training dataset, where the first arguments specifies
trained model and the second an option file containing the path of the dataset for
evaulation. The extensions of the model, if any, can be specified via the ``-e`` flag.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 98-99

.. code-block:: Bash

    mtt eval model.pt eval-basic.yaml -e extensions/

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 100-104

The evaluation command predicts those properties the model was trained against; here
``"U0"``. The predictions together with the systems have been written in a file named
``output.xyz`` in the current directory. The written file starts with the following
lines

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 107-108

.. code-block:: Bash

    head -n 20 output.xyz

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 109-110

All command line flags of the eval sub-command can be listed via

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 113-114

.. code-block:: Bash

    mtt eval --help

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 114-122

An important parameter of ``mtt eval`` is the ``-b`` (or ``--batch-size``) option,
which allows you to specify the batch size for the evaluation.

Molecular simulations
---------------------

The trained model can also be used to run molecular simulations.
You can find how in the :ref:`tutorials` section.
