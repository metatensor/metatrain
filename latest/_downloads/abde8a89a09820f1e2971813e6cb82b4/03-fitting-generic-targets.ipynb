Suppose you want to learn a target named ``mtt::my_target``, which is\nrepresented as a set of 10 independent per-atom 3D Cartesian vector (we need to\nlearn 3x10 values for each atom). The ``target`` section in the input file\nshould look\nlike this:\n\n```yaml\ntargets:\n  mtt::my_target:\n    read_from: dataset.xyz\n    key: my_target\n    quantity: \"\"\n    unit: \"\"\n    per_atom: True\n    type:\n      cartesian:\n        rank: 1\n    num_subtargets: 10\n```\nThe crucial fields here are:\n\n- ``per_atom``: This field should be set to ``True`` if the target is a per-atom\n    property. Otherwise, it should be set to ``False``.\n- ``type``: This field specifies the type of the target. In this case, the target is\n    a Cartesian vector. The ``rank`` field specifies the rank of the target. For\n    Cartesian vectors, the rank is 1. Other possibilities for the ``type`` are\n    ``scalar`` (for a scalar target) and ``spherical`` (for a spherical tensor).\n- ``num_subtargets``: This field specifies the number of sub-targets that need to be\n    learned as part of this target. They are treated as entirely equivalent by models in\n    metatrain and will often be represented as outputs of the same neural network layer.\n    A common use case for this field is when you are learning a discretization of a\n    continuous target, such as the grid points of a band structure. In the example\n    above, there are 10 sub-targets. In ``metatensor``, these correspond to the number\n    of ``properties`` of the target.\n\nA few more words should be spent on ``spherical`` targets. These should be made of a\ncertain number of irreducible spherical tensors. For example, if you are learning a\nproperty that can be decomposed into two proper spherical tensors with L=0 and L=2,\nthe target section should would look like this:\n\n```yaml\ntargets:\n  mtt::my_target:\n    quantity: \"\"\n    read_from: dataset.xyz\n    key: energy\n    unit: \"\"\n    per_atom: True\n    type:\n      spherical:\n        irreps:\n            - {o3_lambda: 0, o3_sigma: 1}\n            - {o3_lambda: 2, o3_sigma: 1}\n    num_subtargets: 10\n```\nwhere ``o3_lambda`` specifies the L value of the spherical tensor and ``o3_sigma`` its\nparity with respect to inversion (1 for proper tensors, -1 for pseudo-tensors).\n\n### Preparing your targets -- ASE\n\nIf you are using the ASE readers to read your targets, you will have to save them\neither in the ``.info`` (if the target is per structure, i.e. not per atom) or in the\n``.arrays`` (if the target is per atom) attributes of the ASE atoms object. Then you can\ndump the atoms object to a file using ``ase.io.write``.\n\nThe ASE reader will automatically try to reshape the target data to the format expected\ngiven the target section in the input file. In case your target data is invalid, an\nerror will be raised.\n\nReading targets with more than one spherical tensor is not supported by the ASE reader.\nIn that case, you should use the metatensor reader.\n\n### Preparing your targets -- metatensor\n\nIf you are using the metatensor readers to read your targets, you will have to save them\nas a ``metatensor.torch.TensorMap`` object with ``metatensor.torch.TensorMap.save()``\ninto a file with the ``.mts`` extension.\n\nThe metatensor reader will verify that the target data in the input files corresponds to\nthe metadata in the provided ``TensorMap`` objects. In case of a mismatch, errors will\nbe raised.\n\nIn particular:\n\n- if the target is per atom, the samples should have the [``system``, ``atom``] names,\n  otherwise the [``system``] name. In order to produce correct results, per-atom targets\n  should be prepared in the same order as the atoms in the system. This means that you\n  should use e.g. ``metatensor.torch.sort`` to sort the atoms in your target.\n- if the target is a ``scalar``, only one ``TensorBlock`` should be present, the keys\n  of the ``TensorMap`` should be a ``Labels.single()`` object, and there should be no\n  components.\n- if the target is a ``cartesian`` tensor, only one ``TensorBlock`` should be present,\n  the keys of the ``TensorMap`` should be a ``Labels.single()`` object, and there should\n  be one components, with names [``xyz``] for a rank-1 tensor,\n  [``xyz_1``, ``xyz_2``, etc.] for higher rank tensors.\n- if the target is a ``spherical`` tensor, the ``TensorMap`` can contain multiple\n  ``TensorBlock``, each corresponding to one irreducible spherical tensor. The keys of\n  the ``TensorMap`` should have the ``o3_lambda`` and ``o3_sigma`` names, corresponding\n  to the values provided in the input file, and each ``TensorBlock`` should be one\n  component label, with name ``o3_mu`` and values going from -L to L.\n"
