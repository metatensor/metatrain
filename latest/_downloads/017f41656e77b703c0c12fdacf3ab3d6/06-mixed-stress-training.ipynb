This is useful when\nworking with:\n\n- Bulk materials with well-defined stress tensors\n- Molecules where stress is not physically meaningful\n- Slabs (surfaces) with non-periodic boundary conditions where stress is undefined\n\n``metatrain`` handles this automatically by allowing structures with NaN stress values.\n"

        "## Key Points\n\n1. **Use NaN for undefined stress**: When stress is not defined for a structure,\n   set the stress tensor to ``np.full((3, 3), np.nan, dtype=np.float64)``.\n\n2. **Mixed training is automatic**: ``metatrain`` automatically handles the mixed\n   dataset during training, only computing stress loss for structures where stress\n   is defined (not NaN).\n\n3. **All structures need stress field**: Even if stress is not defined for some\n   structures, the stress field must be present in the dataset. Use NaN values\n   for structures where stress is undefined.\n\n4. **Force training works normally**: Forces can be trained for all structure types\n   (bulk, molecules, and slabs) without any special handling.\n\nThis feature is particularly useful when:\n\n- Training models that need to work across different system types\n- Working with surface calculations where stress is only meaningful in periodic\n  directions\n- Combining datasets from different sources where stress information may not be\n  available for all structures\n\n"
