# Example of using PET with the "fast" preset
# The preset option allows you to quickly select pre-configured
# hyperparameters optimized for different use cases.
#
# Available presets for PET:
# - fast: Small model, optimized for speed
# - medium: Balanced model (default-like behavior)
# - large: Large model, optimized for accuracy
#
# You can still override specific hyperparameters after setting a preset.

architecture:
  name: pet
  preset: fast  # Use the fast preset
  # You can override specific hyperparameters if needed:
  # model:
  #   cutoff: 4.0  # Override just the cutoff

# Mandatory section defining the parameters for system and target data of the
# training set
training_set:
  systems: qm9_reduced_100.xyz  # file where the positions are stored
  targets:
    energy:
      key: U0  # name of the target value
      unit: eV  # unit of the target value

test_set: 0.1  # 10 % of the training_set are randomly split and taken for test set
validation_set: 0.1  # 10 % of the training_set are randomly split and for validation
