Running molecular dynamics with ASE
===================================

This tutorial demonstrates how to use an already trained and exported model to run an
ASE simulation of a single ethanol molecule in vacuum. We use a model that was trained
using the :ref:`architecture-soap-bpnn` architecture on 100 ethanol systems
containing energies and forces. You can obtain the :download:`dataset file
<ethanol_reduced_100.xyz>` used in this example from our website. The dataset is a
subset of the `rMD17 dataset
<https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/abba6f/meta>`_.

The model was trained using the following training options.

.. literalinclude:: options-ase.yaml
   :language: yaml

We first train the model same model but and before import the necessary libraries and
run the training process and the integration of ASE.

# fluctuate but the total energy is conserved over the length of the simulation.
