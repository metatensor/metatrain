Fine-tuning a pre-trained model
===============================

.. warning::

  Finetuning is currently only available for the PET architecture.


This is a simple example for fine-tuning PET-MAD (or a general PET model), that
can be used as a template for general fine-tuning with metatrain.
Fine-tuning a pretrained model allows you to obtain a model better suited for
your specific system. You need to provide a dataset of structures that have
been evaluated at a higher reference level of theory, usually DFT. Fine-tuning
a universal model such as PET-MAD allows for reasonable model performance even if little
training data is available.
It requires using a pre-trained model checkpoint with the ``mtt train`` command and
setting the new targets corresponding to the new level of theory in the ``options.yaml``
file.


In order to obtain a pretrained model, you can use a PET-MAD checkpoint from huggingface

.. code-block:: bash

  wget https://huggingface.co/lab-cosmo/pet-mad/resolve/v1.1.0/models/pet-mad-v1.1.0.ckpt

Next, we set up the ``options.yaml`` file. Here we specify to fine-tune on a small model
dataset containing structures of ethanol, labelled with energies and forces.
We can specify the fine-tuning method in the ``finetune`` block in the ``training``
options of the ``architecture``. Here, the basic ``full`` option is chosen, which
finetunes all weights of the model. All available fine-tuning methods are found in the
concepts page :ref:`Fine-tuning <label_fine_tuning_concept>`. This section discusses
implementation details, options and recommended use cases. Other fine-tuning options can
be simply substituted in this script, by changing the ``finetune`` block.

.. note::

  Since our dataset has energies and forces obtained from reference calculations,
  different from the reference of the pretrained model, it is recommended to create a
  new energy head. Using this so-called energy variant can be simply invoked by
  requesting a new target in the options file. Follow the nomenclature
  energy/{yourname}.


Furthermore, you need to specify the checkpoint, that you want to fine-tune in
the ``read_from`` option.

A simple ``options-ft.yaml`` file for this task could look like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    architecture:
      name: pet
      training:
        batch_size: 8
        num_epochs: 10
        learning_rate: 1e-3
        warmup_fraction: 0.01
        finetune:
          method: full
          read_from: pet-mad-v1.1.0.ckpt
          inherit_heads:
            energy/finetune: energy # inherit weights from the "energy" head

    training_set:
      systems:
        read_from: ethanol_reduced_100.xyz
        reader: ase
        length_unit: angstrom
      targets:
        energy/finetune:
          quantity: energy
          read_from: ethanol_reduced_100.xyz
          reader: ase
          key: energy
          unit: eV
          description: "pbe energy ethanol"
          forces:
            read_from: ethanol_reduced_100.xyz
            reader: ase
            key: forces

    validation_set: 0.1
    test_set: 0.1


In this example, we specified a low number of :attr:`num_epochs` and a relatively high
:attr:`learning_rate`, for short compilation time. Usually, the ``learning_rate`` is
chosen to be relatively low. Typically lower, than the ``learning_rate`` that the model
has been per-trained on.
to stabilise training.

.. warning::

  Note that in ``targets`` we use the ``energy/finetune`` head, differing from the
  default ``energy`` head. This means, that the model creates a new head with a new
  composition model for the new reference energies provided in your dataset. While
  the old energy reference is still available, it is rendered useless, as we trained
  all weights of the model. If you want to obtain a model with multiple energy heads,
  you can simply train on multiple energy references simultaneously. This and other
  more advanced fine-tuning strategies are discussed in
  :ref:`Fine-tuning concepts <label_fine_tuning_concept>`.


We assumed that the pre-trained model is trained on the dataset
``ethanol_reduced_100.xyz`` in which energies are written in the ``energy`` key of
the ``info`` dictionary of the dataset.
Additionally, forces should be provided with corresponding keys
which you can specify in the ``options-ft.yaml`` file under ``targets``.
Further information on specifying targets can be found in the :ref:`data section of
the Training YAML Reference <data-section>`.

.. note::

  It is important that the ``length_unit`` is set to ``angstrom`` and the ``energy``
  ``unit`` is ``eV`` in order to match the units of your reference data.


After setting up your ``options-ft.yaml`` file, you can then simply run:

.. code-block:: bash

  mtt train options-ft.yaml -o model-ft.pt

You can check finetuning training curves by parsing the ``train.csv`` that is written
by ``mtt train``. We remove the old outputs folder from other examples, which
is not necessary for the normal usage.

# You can see that the validation loss still decreases, however, for the sake of brevity
# of this exercise we only finetuned for a few epochs. As further check for how well
# your fine-tuned model performs on a dataset of choice, we can check the parity plots
# for energy and force
# (see :ref:`sphx_glr_generated_examples_0-beginner_04-parity_plot.py`).
# For evaluation, we can compare performance of our fine-tuned model and the base model
# PET-MAD. Using ``mtt eval`` we can simply evaluate our new energy head, by specifying
# it in the options-ft-eval.yaml:
#
# .. code-block:: yaml
#
#   systems: ethanol_reduced_100.xyz
#   targets:
#     energy/finetune:
#       key: energy
#       unit: eV
#       forces:
#         key: forces
#
# and then run
#
# .. code-block:: bash
#
#  mtt eval model-ft.pt options-ft-eval.yaml -o output-ft.xyz
#
# Then you can simply read the predicted energies in the headers of the xyz file.
# Another possibility is to load your fine-tuned model ``model-ft.pt`` as ``metatomic``
# model and evaluate energies and forces with ASE in Python.
