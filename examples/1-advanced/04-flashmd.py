Training a FlashMD model
========================

This tutorial demonstrates how to train a FlashMD model for the direct prediction
of molecular dynamics. This type of model affords faster MD simulations compared to
MLIPs by a factor between 10 and 30 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19350).

#
# Data generation
# ---------------
#
# FlashMD models train on molecular dynamics trajectories in the NVE ensemble (i.e.,
# most often with the velocity Verlet integrator). These trajectories can be generated
# with almost any MD code (i-PI, LAMMPS, etc.). Here, for simplicity, we will use ASE
# and its built-in EMT potential. In reality, you might want to use a more accurate
# baseline such as ab initio MD or a machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP).

# We start by creating a simple system (a small box of aluminum).
atoms = ase.build.bulk("Al", "fcc", cubic=True) * (2, 2, 2)

# We first equilibrate the system at 300K using a Langevin thermostat.

    atoms, 2 * ase.units.fs, temperature_K=300, friction=1 / (100 * ase.units.fs)
)
dyn.run(1000)  # 2 ps equilibration (around 10 ps is better in practice)

# Then, we run a production simulation in the NVE ensemble.

# %%
#
# Data preparation
# ----------------
#
# Now, we need to generate the training data from the trajectory. FlashMD models
# require future positions and momenta as targets. We will save them in an `.xyz`
# file under the `future_positions` and `future_momenta` keys.

# The FlashMD model will be trained to predict 30 steps into the future, i.e., 30 fs
# since we ran the reference simulation with a time step of 1 fs. For this type
# of system, FlashMD is expected to perform well up to around 60-80 fs.
time_lag = 30

# We pick starting structures that are 200 steps apart. To avoid wasting training
# structures, this should be set to be around the expected velocity-velocity
# autocorrelation time for the system. This is the time scale that quantifies how long
# it takes for the system to forget its original velocities.

# Write the structures to an xyz file
ase.io.write("flashmd.xyz", structures_for_dataset)

# %%
#
# Training the model
# ------------------
#
# The dataset is now ready for training. You can now provide it to ``metatrain`` and
# train your FlashMD model!
#
# For example, you can use the following options file:
#
# .. literalinclude:: options-flashmd.yaml
# .. literalinclude:: options-flashmd.yaml
#    :language: yaml
