model-v1 is not tested from here, but it's tested from the other LLPR tests via the
PET-MAD v1.0.2 checkpoint

In addition, every time the PET architecture is updated, the LLPR checkpoint tests will fail,
but it will be sufficient to replace the latest LLPR checkpoint by the new one that
is automatically generated
