Dataset formats
===============

Training, validation, and test data are loaded from the ``read_from`` path in
the ``systems`` section of the options file. The path determines which dataset
reader is used:

- ASE-readable files, such as ``.xyz`` files, are read into memory
- ``.zip`` files are read from disk one structure at a time
- directories are interpreted as memory-mapped datasets, which is usually the
  best option for large datasets.

The ``targets`` and ``extra_data`` sections have the same meaning for all three
formats. Switching from an ``.xyz`` file to a zip archive or memory-mapped
directory usually only requires changing ``read_from``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    training_set:
      systems:
        read_from: dataset.xyz       # ASE-readable file, or
        # read_from: dataset.zip     # zip file, or
        # read_from: my_dataset/     # memory-mapped directory
        length_unit: angstrom
      targets:
        energy:
          key: energy
          unit: eV

ASE-readable files
------------------

Most examples in the documentation use files read by ASE. In this case,
per-structure quantities, such as energies or extra data like ``charge``, are
read from ``atoms.info[key]``. Per-atom quantities, such as forces, are read
from ``atoms.arrays[key]``. Not every target type can be stored this way,
spherical tensors with more than one irreducible representation cannot be read
by the ASE reader.

Targets can also be read from metatensor ``.mts`` files (one ``TensorMap`` per
structure) by setting the target's ``read_from`` option to the corresponding
file. See
:doc:`../getting-started/train_yaml_config` for the full data configuration
reference.

Zip files
---------

A zip dataset (:py:class:`metatrain.utils.data.DiskDataset`) contains one
folder for each structure, named by index:

.. code-block:: text

    dataset.zip
    ├── 0/
    │   ├── system.mta
    │   ├── energy.mts
    │   └── charge.mts
    ├── 1/
    │   └── ...
    └── ...

Each target or extra-data entry is a separate ``.mts`` file containing a per-structure
``metatensor.torch.TensorMap``. The file is selected by the ``key`` option of the
corresponding section, as for the other formats. If no ``key`` is given, the section
name is used.

The easiest way to create such a file is the
:py:class:`metatrain.utils.data.writers.DiskDatasetWriter` class, which takes care of
the serialization details (see
:ref:`sphx_glr_generated_examples_0-beginner_01-data_preparation.py` for an example).

Memory-mapped directories
-------------------------

A memory-mapped dataset (:py:class:`metatrain.utils.data.dataset.MemmapDataset`)
is a directory of NumPy and raw binary arrays. It uses the following files:

- ``ns.npy``: number of structures, shape ``(1,)``
- ``na.npy``: cumulative number of atoms per structure, shape ``(ns + 1,)``,
  ``int64``
- ``x.bin``: positions of all atoms, concatenated, shape ``(na[-1], 3)``,
  ``float32``
- ``a.bin``: atomic types of all atoms, concatenated, shape ``(na[-1],)``,
  ``int32``
- ``c.bin`` (optional): cell matrices, shape ``(ns, 3, 3)``, ``float32``
- ``<key>.bin``: one file per target and extra-data entry, named after the
  corresponding ``key`` option. Per-structure quantities have shape
  ``(ns, ..., num_subtargets)``, while per-atom quantities have shape
  ``(na[-1], ..., num_subtargets)``. These arrays are stored as ``float32``.

Forces and stresses of an energy target use the same convention, with file
names taken from their own ``key`` options. Extra data, for example
``charge.bin`` or ``spin_multiplicity.bin``, must contain per-structure scalar
values with shape ``(ns, 1)``.

Spherical targets and virials are not supported in this format. A complete
walkthrough, including forces and stresses, is available in
:ref:`sphx_glr_generated_examples_0-beginner_01-data_preparation.py`.
