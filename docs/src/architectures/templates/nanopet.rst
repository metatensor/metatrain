NanoPET (deprecated)
======================

.. warning::

  This is a **deprecated model**. You should not use it for anything important, and
  support for it will be removed in future versions of metatrain. Please use the
  :ref:`PET model <architecture-pet>` instead.

Installation
------------

To install this architecture along with the ``metatrain`` package, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install metatrain[{architecture}]

where the square brackets indicate that you want to install the optional
dependencies required for ``{architecture}``.

Default Hyperparameters
-----------------------

The description of all the hyperparameters used in ``{architecture}`` is provided
further down this page. However, here we provide you with a yaml file containing all
the default hyperparameters, which might be convenient as a starting point to
create your own hyperparameter files:

.. literalinclude:: {default_hypers_path}
   :language: yaml

The parameters that go under the ``architecture.model`` section of the config file
are the following:

.. autoclass:: {model_hypers_path}
    :members:
    :undoc-members:

.. _{architecture}_trainer_hypers:

Trainer hyperparameters
-------------------------

The parameters that go under the ``architecture.trainer`` section of the config file
are the following:
