GAP
===

This is an implementation of the sparse `Gaussian Approximation Potential
<GAP_>`_ (GAP) using `Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions <SOAP_>`_ (SOAP)
implemented in `rascaline <RASCALINE_>`_.


.. _SOAP: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.87.184115
.. _GAP:  https://doi.org/10.1002/qua.24927
.. _RASCALINE: https://github.com/Luthaf/rascaline

The GAP model in metatrain can only train on CPU, but evaluation
is also supported on GPU.


Installation
------------

To install the package, you can run the following command in the root directory
of the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install .[gap]

This will install the package with the GAP dependencies.


Default Hyperparameters
-----------------------
The default hyperparameters for the GAP model are:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../src/metatrain/experimental/gap/default-hypers.yaml
   :language: yaml


Tuning Hyperparameters
----------------------
The default hyperparameters above will work well in most cases, but they
may not be optimal for your specific dataset. In general, the most important
hyperparameters to tune are (in decreasing order of importance):

- ``cutoff``: This should be set to a value after which most of the
  interactions between atoms is expected to be negligible.
- ``num_sparse_points``: Number of sparse points to use during
  the training, it select the number of actual samples
  to use during the training. The selection is done with
  the Further Point Sampling (FPS) algorithm.
  The optimal number of sparse points depends on the system.
  Increasing it might impreve the accuracy, but it also increase the
  memory and time required for training.
- ``regularizer``: Value of the regularizer for the energy. It should
  be tuned depending on the specific dataset. If it is too small might
  lead to overfitting, if it is too big might lead to bad accuracy.
- ``regularizer_forces``: Value of the regularizer for the forces. It has
  a similar effect as ``regularizer``. By default is set equal to ``regularizer``.
  It might be changed to have better accuracy.
- ``max_radial``, ``max_angular``:
  These hyperparameters control the size and depth of the SOAP descriptors, in
  particularthe total number of radial and angular channels.
  In general, increasing these hyperparameters might lead to better accuracy,
  especially on larger datasets, at the cost of increased training and evaluation time.
- ``radial_scaling`` hyperparameters: These hyperparameters control the radial scaling
  of the SOAP descriptor. In general, the default values should work well, but they
  might need to be adjusted for specific datasets.
- ``degree``: degree of the kernel. For now, only 2 is allowed.

:param name: ``experimental.gap``

model
#####
soap
^^^^
:param cutoff: Spherical cutoff (Å) to use for atomic environments. Default 5.0
:param max_radial: Number of radial basis function to use. Default 8
:param max_angular: Number of angular basis function to use also denoted by the  maximum
    degree of spherical harmonics. Default 6
:param atomic_gaussian_width: Width of the atom-centered gaussian creating the atomic
    density. Default 0.3
:param center_atom_weight: Weight of the central atom contribution to the features. If
    1.0 the center atom contribution is weighted the same as any other contribution. If
    0.0 the central atom does not contribute to the features at all. Default 1.0
:param cutoff_function: cutoff function used to smooth the behavior around the cutoff
    radius. The supported cutoff function are

    - ``Step``: Step function, 1 if ``r < cutoff`` and 0 if ``r >= cutoff``. This cutoff
      function takes no additional parameters and can set as in ``.yaml`` file:

      .. code-block:: yaml

        cutoff_function:
          Step:

    - ``ShiftedCosine`` (Default value): Shifted cosine switching function
      ``f(r) = 1/2 * (1 + cos(π (r- cutoff + width) / width ))``.
      This cutoff function takes the ``width``` as
      additional parameter and can set as in ``options.yaml`` file as:

      .. code-block:: yaml

        cutoff_function:
          ShiftedCosine:
            width: 1.0

:param radial_scaling: Radial scaling can be used to reduce the importance of neighbor
    atoms further away from the center, usually improving the performance of the model.
    The supported radial scaling functions are

    - ``None``: No radial scaling.

      .. code-block:: yaml

        radial_scaling:
          None:

    - ``Willatt2018`` (Default value): Use a long-range algebraic decay and
      smooth behavior at :math:`r
      \rightarrow 0`: as introduced by :footcite:t:`willatt_feature_2018` as ``f(r) =
      rate / (rate + (r / scale) ^ exponent)`` This radial scaling function can be set
      in the ``options.yaml`` file as.

      .. code-block:: yaml

        radial_scaling:
          Willatt2018:
            rate: 1.0
            scale: 2.0
            exponent: 7.0

.. note::

  Currently, we only support a Gaussian type orbitals (GTO) as radial basis functions
  and radial integrals.

^^^^
:param degree: degree of the polynomial kernel. Default 2
:param num_sparse_points: number of pseudo points to select
    (by farthest point sampling). Default 500
