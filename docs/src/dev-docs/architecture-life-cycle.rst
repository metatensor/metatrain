Life Cycle of an Architecture
=============================

.. TODO: Maybe add a flowchart later

Architectures in `metatensor-models` undergo different stages based on their
development/functionality level and maintenance status. We distinguish three distinct
stages: **experimental**, **stable**, and **deprecated**. Typically, an architecture
starts as experimental, advances to stable, and eventually becomes deprecated before
removal if maintenance is no longer feasible.

.. note::
    The development and maintenance of an architecture must be fully undertaken by the
    architecture's authors or maintainers. The core developers of `metatensor-models`
    provide infrastructure and implementation support but are not responsible for the
    architecture's internal functionality or any issues that may arise therein.

Experimental Architectures
---------------------------

New architectures added to the library will initially be classified as experimental.
These architectures are stored in the ``experimental`` subdirectory within the
repository. To qualify as an experimental architecture, certain criteria must be met:

1. Capability to fit at least a single quantity and predict it, verified through CI
   tests.
2. Compatibility with JIT compilation using `TorchScript
   <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html>`_.
3. Provision of reasonable default hyperparameters.
4. Minimal code quality, ensured by passing linting tests invoked with ``tox -e lint``.
5. A contact person designated as the maintainer.
6. All external dependencies must be pip-installable. While not required to be on PyPI,
   a public git repository or another public URL with a repository is acceptable.

For detailed instructions on adding a new architecture, refer to
:ref:`adding-new-models`.

Stable Architectures
--------------------

Transitioning from an experimental to a stable model requires additional criteria to be
satisfied:

1. Provision of regression prediction tests with a small (not exported) checkpoint file.
2. Comprehensive architecture documentation
3. If an architecture has external dependencies, all must be publicly available on PyPI.
4. Adherence to the standard output infrastructure of `metatensor-models`, including
   logging and model save locations.

Deprecated Architectures
------------------------

An architecture will be deemed deprecated if its maintainer becomes irresponsive
any of its CI jobs fail. Such an architecture will be **removed after 6 months** unless
a new maintainer is found who can address the issues. If rectified within this 6-month
period, the model may revert to its previous stable or experimental status.
